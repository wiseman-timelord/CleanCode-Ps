# CleanCode-Ps
Its the Updated Powershell conversion of ScriptClean, I intend to also...
- add cleaning of ascii codes from error logs.
- improve a little on the cleaning logic, to include entry points at bottom of script, that are currently being merged with last function.
- After doing this I will revisit scriptclean and rebrand it to CleanCode-Py, carrying over the improvements.
